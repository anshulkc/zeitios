Okay here's what I did(chatgpt did):
- Created the server folder with server.ts as what we run to communicate with backend 
- Updated the ChatInterface.tsx to be compatible and send files between the backend and front end.
- Updated the tsconfig.json, package.json, etc to add the server.ts support.
- Added Chat.tsx - another chat component, separate from your ChatInterface.tsx. It expects a backend server running at http://localhost:3001/chat to handle messages.
- To get it working, in the server folder run in a terminal
"npm run start" 
- Then in a seperate terminal, within the Zeitios folder:
"npm run dev" 
- On the website, say any topic for now, it doesnt do anything.
- Once that chat opens at the bottom you can talk with gpt.

Going forward:
- Rn it runs kinda slow, like when you press enter it doesn't appear that anything is happening, but it DID send the prompt and is sending data/fetching a response. 
- Maybe we can update it to be more interactive and close the chat menu until the response is received.
- the initial prompt to the AI is just whatever the user sends it, its not marketing oriented or anything so we could add functionality for that
- Maybe a way to restrict the ai to only AI topics.
- Make the website prettier lol 

Bottom line is we now have a slower running chat gpt, but its through our website :D

Aidan's Addendum:
- added AI is typing... to ChatInterface.tsv
- also, make sure API key is up to date.
- made it so our messages appear when chatting with AI
- tried to make headers appear (###, ##, #) with markdown but only got bold and italics to work
- tried to make the messages jump to the most recent sent but right now we have to manually scroll
- installed some packages to try to get these to work via react, so if bugs encountered that may be why.
    - added "@tailwindcss/typography" to config for bolding in chat. <- may have to "npm install" this!


IMPORTANT:
Anshul here! :/
--> I created a command called "npm run both" so that you don't need to call both the server and vite at the same time
Should make life easier LOL
